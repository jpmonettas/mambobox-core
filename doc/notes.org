* Roadmap/Ideas
** Geolocalized mambo events

** Play music offline
** Mambo trivia 
   After getting a significat amount of classified music play random parts of random classified music
   and make users guess by choosing options like artist/albums/tags/song-names etc
** Album art
   Make something for users to upload an album photo, normalize it, and show it in lists
** Make it social
   Do the phone number SMS thing like whatsapp, so it can know which of your contacts has the app
   Then it can do things like dedicate a song, etc
